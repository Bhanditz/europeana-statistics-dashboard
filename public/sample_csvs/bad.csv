"Anhydrite pseudomorphs and the origin of stratiform Cu-Co ores in the Katangan Copperbelt","Muchez, P.||Vanderhaeghen, P.||El Desouky, H.||Schneider, J.||Boyce, A.||Dewaele, S.||Cailteux, J.","","","","PROMINES","The stratiform Cu-Co ore deposits in the Katangan Copperbelt consist of dispersed sulphides, sulphides in nodules and lenses, which are often pseudomorphs after evaporites, and in veins. Two types of pseudomorphs can be distinguished in the nodules and lenses. In Type 1 examples, dolomite precipitated first and was subsequently replaced by Cu-Co sulphides and authigenic quartz, whereas in Type 2 examples, authigenic quartz and Cu-Co sulphides precipitated prior to dolomite and are coarse-grained.   The sulphur isotopic composition of the copper-cobalt sulphides in the Type 1 pseudomorphs is between -10.3 and 3.1 V-CDT, indicating that the sulphide was derived from bacterial sulphate reduction (BSR). The generation of HCO3- during this process caused the precipitation and replacement of anhydrite by dolomite. A second product of BSR is the generation of H2S. We suggest that metals in the mineralising fluid reacted with the H2S, resulting in the precipitation of Cu-Co sulphides. Initial sulphide precipitation occurred along the rim of the pseudomorphs and continued towards the core. Precipitation of authigenic quartz was most likely induced by a pH decrease during sulphide precipitation.   Fluid inclusion data from quartz indicate the presence of a high-salinity (8-18 eq. wt% NaCl) mineralising fluid, possibly derived from evaporated seawater which migrated through the deep subsurface. 87Sr/86Sr ratios of dolomite in Type 1 nodules range between 0.71012 and 0.73576 significantly more radiogenic than the strontium isotopic composition of Neoproterozoic marine carbonates (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7056-0.7087). This suggests intense interaction with siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and/or the granitic basement. The low carbon isotopic composition of the dolomite in the pseudomorphs (-7.02 and -9.93 V-PDB) compared to the host rock dolomites (-4.90 and +1.31  V-PDB) resulted from the oxidation of organic matter during BSR.

(Meta)granitoids and gneisses in north-central Bayuda Desert record a 920-900Ma orogenic event, hitherto unrecognized in northeastern Africa. This early Neoproterozoic Bayudian event is restricted to a pre-Pan-African crustal terrane which appears only slightly affected by Pan-African tectogenesis and deformation, named here the Rahaba-Absol terrane. Within this terrane, amphibolite-facies metamorphism occurred at 921±10Ma in the El Melagi muscovite-biotite gneiss of the Rahaba Series, probably during a collisional phase; followed by the intrusion of the Absol medium-K granite-granodiorite pluton discordantly emplaced at 900±9Ma into high-grade schists and amphibolites of the metavolcanosedimentary Absol Series. Nd TDM model ages (2040-2430 Ma) and ages of rounded zircon cores (1060, 1980, 2540 and 2675 Ma) of the El Melagi gneiss indicate a predominantly late Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic source region and suggest a latest Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic depositional age of its pelitic precursor sediment. The post-collisional Absol pluton has isotope characteristics (Nd-Sr-Pb) indicating assimilation of old pre-Neoproterozoic crust. The Rahaba-Absol terrane is part of the Saharan Metacraton and is in tectonic contact with the high-grade metamorphic Kurmut terrane of eastern Bayuda Desert. The Kurmut terrane has juvenile Neoproterozoic isotope characteristics, its granitoids record only Pan-African orogenic events and it is therefore considered a part of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Both the Rahaba-Absol and the Kurmut terrane of the Bayuda Desert are intruded by post-collisional high-K granitoid magmatism of late Pan-African age, with no intermediate events recorded.

"Pb-Zn mineralization in a Miocene regional extensional context: The case of the Sidi Driss and the Douahria ore deposits (Nefza mining district, northern Tunisia).","Decrée, S.||Marignac, Ch.||De Putter, Th.||Deloule, E.||Liégeois, J.-P.||Demaiffe, D.","","","","Geodynamics and mineral resources","The Sidi Driss and Douahria sulfide ore deposits and showings are located in the Nefza mining district, northern Tunisia. The ores are hosted within Upper Miocene (Messinian) basins, within carbonate lenses composed of FeMn-enriched dedolomite partially or totally replaced by early barite and celestite. The ore mainly consists of galena and spherulitic/colloform sphalerite (partially replaced by later Fe-sulfides). It is present as disseminated or banded ores and has been deposited within the host-rock through dissolution/replacement process or through void infilling. The remaining voids are filled by late calcite/barite locally associated with a late oxidation event. In situ ion microprobe sulfur isotope analyses show significant variability for sphalerite (from &#8722; 43.9 to 1.2), galena (from &#8722; 30.3 to &#8722; 2) and marcasite ä34S (from &#8722; 35.9 to 25.8). These values are interpreted as the result of (i) the mixing of two sulfur end-members in the mineralizing fluids, corresponding to different reduction processes (bacterially-mediated sulfate reduction and thermochemical sulfate reduction, with early celestite and barite and/or contemporaneous Messinian seawater, together with Triassic sulfate, as sulfur sources, and (ii) Rayleigh fractionation process in a closed system. Several arguments (FeMn enrichment in early diagenetic carbonates, involvement of Messinian seawater as a sulfur source, low temperature of deposition and soft-style sedimentary figures within sulfides) suggest that the Sidi Driss and Douahria PbZn ore deposits are syn-diagenetic. Moreover, the properties of the ore deposits, with FeMn carbonates having a wider distribution than that of the base metal sulfides, and the characteristics of the mineralization, in which diagenetic sulfates are a sulfur source and Cd enrichment in sphalerite, support the classification of the Sidi Driss and Douahria PbZn deposits as SHMS-Sedex type. Late Miocene extension, comprising rifting dynamics and basalt emplacement, favored a thermally-driven fluid circulation origin for the Sidi Driss and Douahria deposits, enhancing inception of small-scale shallow convection cells. Such sulfide emplacement is significantly different from that of southernmost MVT ore deposits of Tunisia, which are associated with diapirs and are interpreted as the result of a SerravalianTortonian gravity-driven fluid circulation event related to late Alpine convergence.

It forms a met- allogenic   province that hosts different types of granite-related mineralization: cassiterite,   columbite-tantalite, wolframite, gold, monazite, amblygonite, beryl, etc. These minerals are   present in different types of mineralization. The minerals occur as primary mineraliza- tion in   quartz veins and pegmatites, but also as secondary mineralization in alluvial or elu- vial   deposits. In this study, we focus on the metallogeny of the primary tin and columbite- tantalite   mineralization in the northern part of the Kibara orogen (Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania,   Maniema and Kivu in the DRC). Based on a systematic overview of mining data in the archives of the   RMCA, field work, petrography, geochemical, miner- alogical and microthermometric investigations of   ore and gangue minerals and based on a comparison with recent ore-forming models of granite-related   ore deposits, a preliminary metallogenic model is proposed.  The main granite generation G1-3 intruded at 1380 +/- 10 Ma in the Palaeo- and Mesoproterozoic   rocks of the Kibara orogen. At ~986 Ma, the youngest G4 granite gener- ation formed. Although   historically called tin-granite, this granite generation is not min- eralized. After   consolidation of the G4-granite, pegmatites were emplaced (~ 960 Ma). Some of these pegmatites are   mineralized in columbite-tantalite. At ~940 Ma, cassiterite- mineralized quartz veins formed. In   the pegmatite area, this hydrothermal phase resulted  in an intense alteration of the pegmatitic bodies.

Several new ultrastructural features are reported, including putative gland pores associated with the coxal insertions, specialized cheliceral setae, and peculiarly modified male endites. The potential of these and other traits as phylogenetically informative characters is discussed. SEM investigation of the internal female genitalia of A. corbulo reveals the presence of two peculiarly shaped sclerites embedded in the walls of the uterus externus and a reproductive tract with an apparent flow-through design.","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","","","","http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/5919","","","","","American Museum Novitates","3614","","1-30","","","EN","The goblin spider Planetary Biodiversity Inventory (PBI) ( NSF (United States) )","Scientifique","","",""

In highly evolved rifts, tensile stresses from far-field plate motions accumulate over decades before being released during relatively short time intervals by faulting and magmatic intrusions13. These rifting crises are rarely observed in thick lithosphere during the initial stages of rifting. Here we show thatmost of the strain during the JulyAugust 2007 seismic crisis in the weakly extended Natron rift, Tanzania, was released aseismically. Deformation was achieved by slow slip on a normal fault that promoted subsequent dyke intrusion by stress unclamping. This event provides compelling evidence for strain accommodation bymagma intrusion, in addition to slip along normal faults, during the initial stages of continental rifting and before significant crustal thinning.","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","10.1038/nature07478","","","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7223/pdf/nature07478.pdf","","","","","Nature","456, 7223, 11 December 2008","","783-787","","","EN","","Scientifique","","","http://www.africamuseum.be/publication_docs/2008_Calais_al_Natron2007Sismo-volcanicCrisis.pdf::accessrights:public access"
"Interactions between Great Lakes level change, Tectonics and Volcanism in the Rungwe Volcanic Province, SW Highlands of Tanzania","Delvaux, D.||Williamson, D.","","","","Geodynamics and mineral resources","The Rungwe Volcanic Province extends between the Rukwa and Nyasa (Malawi) rift lakes, which both experienced marked water level fluctuations during the last 40 ka. The infilling of water reservoirs, whether artificial or natural, is known to be able to trigger earthquakes and volcanism. In the southwestern Highlands of Tanzania and especially in the Rungwe Volcanic Province, where the western and eastern branches of the East African Rift System meet, a similar link is highlighted. Compilation of available data supplemented by new observations allows investigating the time relations between (1) climatically-induced, rapid water level fluctuations in the surrounding rift lakes, (2) tectonic  activation of the fault systems that extend from the lacustrine depressions to the volcanic  area, and (3) deposition of tephra layers in soils and sediments. The latter are considered  to reflect the frequency and/or magnitude of explosive eruptions in the Rungwe massif. According to these data, a connexion is suggested between the great lakes level change, tectonics, and volcanic activity for the last glacial-interglacial transition (14-11.5 cal. ka BP), and possibly also during the Holocene.","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","0001-4176","","","","","","","","","","Académie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer, Bruxelles, Bulletin des Séances","54(4)","","577-600","","","EN","Geodynamic processes, erosion and sedimentation for the last 30.000 years in the Tanganyika-Rukwa-Malawi Rift area, Western Tanzania ( RMCA )","Scientifique","","","http://www.africamuseum.be/publication_docs/2008_Delvaux-Williamson_Clim-Tecto-Volc.pdf::accessrights:public access"
"Fault kinematics and tectonic stress in the seismically active Manyara-Dodoma Rift segment in Central Tanzania - Implications for the East African Rift","Macheyeki, A.S.||Delvaux, D.||De Batist, M.||Mruma, A.","","","","Geodynamics and mineral resources","The Eastern Branch of the East African Rift System is well known in Ethiopia (Main Ethiopian Rift) and Kenya (Kenya or Gregory  Rift) and is usually considered to fade away southwards in the North Tanzanian Divergence, where it splits into the Eyasi, Manyara and  Pangani segments. Further towards the south, rift structures are more weakly expressed and this area has not attracted much attention  since the mapping and exploratory works of the 1950s. In November 4, 2002, an earthquake of magnitude Mb = 5.5 struck Dodoma, the  capital city of Tanzania. Analysis of modern digital relief, seismological and geological data reveals that ongoing tectonic deformation is  presently affecting a broad NS trending belt, extending southward from the North Tanzanian Divergence to the region of Dodoma,  forming the proposed ManyaraDodoma Rift segment. North of ArushaNgorongoro line, the rift is confined to a narrow belt  (Natron graben in Tanzania) and south of it, it broadens into a wide deformation zone which includes both the Eyasi and Manyara  grabens.  The two-stage rifting model proposed for Kenya and North Tanzania also applies to the ManyaraDodoma Rift segment. In a first  stage, large, well-expressed topographic and volcanogenic structures were initiated in the Natron, Eyasi and Manyara grabens during the  Late Miocene to Pliocene. From the Middle Pleistocene onwards, deformations related to the second rifting stage propagated southwards  to the Dodoma region. These young structures have still limited morphological expressions compared to the structures formed  during the first stage. However, they appear to be tectonically active as shown by the high concentration of moderate earthquakes into  earthquake swarms, the distribution of He-bearing thermal springs, the morphological freshness of the fault scarps, and the presence of  open surface fractures. Fault kinematic and paleostress analysis of geological fault data in basement rocks along the active fault lines  show that recent faults often reactivate older fault systems that were formed under EW to NWSE horizontal compression, compatible  with late Pan-African tectonics. The present-day stress inverted from earthquake focal mechanisms shows that the ManyaraDodoma  Rift segment is presently subjected to an extensional stress field with a N080E direction of horizontal principal extension. Under this  stress field, the rift develops by: (1) reactivation of the pre-existing tectonic planes of weakness, and (2) progressive development of a new  fault system in a more NS trend by the linkage of existing rift faults. This process started about 1.2 Ma ago and is still ongoing.","Elsevier","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2008.01.007","","","","","","","","Journal of African Earth Sciences","51(4)","","463-188","","","EN","","Scientifique","","","http://www.africamuseum.be/publication_docs/2008_Macheyeki_al_NorthDodoma-JAES.pdf::accessrights:public access"

The  pegmatites are dated at -968 Ma, of which some are associated with columbite and  cassiterite mineralization. The columbite precipitated during crystallization of the  pegmatites. Also beryl, spodumene, amblygonite and rare phosphates formed during  this crystallization. The pegmatites underwent intense alteration by hydrothermal  processes: albitization, sericitization (i.e., greisenization in the old literature) and  muscovitization. The cassiterite mineralization in the pegmatitic bodies is associated  with the two latter alteration stages. Sericitization and cassiterite precipitation occurred  from a H20-C02"(X)-NaCl-KCl fluid (Thror between 240 and 370oC; Tm1ce between -19.2  and -8.2°C}. Based on the structural setting, petrographical observations, geochemistry  of the so-called tin granites, stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry, we propose a  model in which Sn was remobilized from primary magmatic rocks by a hydrothermal  system that was installed after the crystallization of the granites and pegmatites, and  precipitated in structurally controlled locations, together with sericitization/  muscovitization of parts of the pegmatites.","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","Etudes Rwandaises","16","","6-24","","","EN","Kibaran Metallogeny ( RMCA )","Scientifique","","",""

"3D and beyond. What graphics cards can do for you","Meganck, B.||Mergen, P.","","","","Invertebrates","Biological mapping and visualisation tools like the ones developed withinBiodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) and GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) context are presented to a public accustomed to gimmicks and eye candy. Compare any map viewer with the rich fly-through world of Google Earth for example, and you'll notice we're missing a dimension. There's something unnatural about our current 2D presentation of biological datasets, about not being able to grab it and look at it from all possible directions - be it a bunch of specimen gathering spots, or a river trajectory, or measuring points on an ape skull. This is more than just eye candy:This is crucial for a good interpretation. And why are we always registering heights for our specimens, if not for using them in 3D? A bold Star-Trek style prediction (this is the "wild ideas" section after all): "We need to conquer the 3rd dimension, or we condemn ourselves to oblivion". 3D in visualisation, but 3D in data space as well: Spatial dataset calculations are an order of magnitude more complex than our current "distances" and "nearest neighbour" questions. How to get the 3D power for this brave new world? A tantalising new approach is GPGPU, or General Processing GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) processing. In normal language: Look for the processing power where it can be found. No other line of computer hardware is under such rapid development as the GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) on the graphics card, with throngs of gamers crying out for ever faster, more spectacular games. GPUs come relatively cheap as well, compared to your normal processor (CPU or Central Processing Unit). And you can string together more than one graphics card nowadays, to get one 3D super-number cruncher. An "idiot savant" supercruncher that is, because GPU's traditionally are built for a single task: Rendering as many frames per seconds as possible on your screen. They excel at shading, rendering 3D scenes and ray tracing (all things 3D), but don't ask them to calculate a square root. Clever software engineers have been working at just that: Tricking 3D graphics cards into "multi-purpose" processing, thus extracting an enormous processing power "on the cheap". Different frameworks exist for programming general science problems into the single-minded graphics card. But rather than losing ourselves in the technical titbits, we'd like to present some examples of what people are doing with this technology:  3D scenery rendering for movie special effects  3D physics animations (effects of gravity and wind on vegetation and constructions )  3D particle behaviour and collision detection (fluids, clouds, sand grains)  Realistic texture rendering (e.g. skin texture) for movies  Software virus signature matching  Encryption and decryption  Random-number generation  Earth subsurface imaging from seismic data We'll also address how GPGPUs could possibly serve in a biological/biodiversity context - as "wild idea" and food for thought:  3D river trajectory calculations for extracting biological parameters (e.g. speed of flow, total length of rivers)  Random-number generating for Monte Carlo algorithms for biological statistics  3D calculations of (nearest neighbour) patterns within a specimen gathering dataset  3D correlation search between parameter layers (e.g. height) and specimen data points  Biological virus signature matching / DNA pattern matching (e.g. in biogeography)  Fast 3D rendering for online GIS (Geographical Information Systems) applications  3D skull and skeleton reconstructions and calculations.

"CABIN: Implementing a Biodiversity Information Network in Central Africa","Kahindo, C.||Theeten, F.||Mergen, P.||Meganck, B.||Jacobsen , K.||Louette, M.","","","","Biological collection and data management||ICT||Invertebrates||Vertebrates","In 2008, the Royal Museum for Central Africa started the CABIN project (Central African Biodiversity Information Network) in the framework of the wider initiative SABIN (Sub-Saharan Biodiversity Information Network). CABIN is supported by the Belgian General Direction of Development Cooperation for a period of 5 years.    Its purpose is to involve scientists from Central Africa in the Information Technology protocols that are currently in force within the scientific community of biodiversity researchers. It contains a capacity building aspect with the installation of databases and web portals that are able to exchange data with the network.    The activities encompassed by this project are:    1: The assessment of needs in Central Africa, in terms of access to information about taxonomy and biodiversity on Internet. This task will run during the first two years of the project.    2: The identification of specimen collections that may be digitized and later published on the Internet. This task will be done by the means of a call for projects, which will be issued after the second year of the project. A jury will evaluate submitted projects and will decide which are eligible for implementation.    3: Capacity Building: The installation of databases and web portals which are able to exchange data with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) network. There is also the need for training staff for the maintenance of this technical infrastructure.    We plan to publish data from partner institutions on our own website and on the GBIF data portal. GBIF already allows access to the biodiversity data from several international institutions. For the transmission of data between the institution providing the data and this thematic portal, we will use software and protocols promoted by TDWG and GBIF.    The project will require the installation of one or two local mirrors of the GBIF portal in Central Africa. The regional indexing of data providers will be undertaken in line with the decentralized architecture of GBIF for contribution to the GBIF network.    CABIN/SABIN will cooperate with the CEDESURK (a documentation centre based at the University of Kinshasa and co-funded by the Walloon and Flemish offices for inter-university co-operation) and Eb@lé (a telecom project promoting education and research in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)) which seek to connect several universities from the Western and Eastern part of the DRC into a common Internet network by using relay-stations for cell-phones as carriers.

Tunisia) has been exploited for about one century. There are, however, very few publications modelling the mineralisation within this 50 m-thick MessinianZanclean sedimentary series. We present the result of a detailed sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical study on the siliciclastic sediments heavily mineralised in iron. In their present state of preservation, these are rather unusual sediments, wherein most of sedimentological information is obliterated by iron impregnation. The whole series consists of a succession of fining-upward sequences (a few meters in thickness) that are capped by clay-bearing variegated and mottled horizons, each sequence being interpreted as a shallowing-upward sequence topped by an emersive horizon corresponding to a paleosoil. We propose that alteration and/or pedogenesis by the downward percolation of meteoric fluids accounts for most of the initial iron concentration, while a hydrothermal overprint, linked to the neighbouring Miocene magmatic rocks and associated mineral deposits (Sidi Driss FePbZn mine), accounts for the existing extreme iron enrichment. The proposed model is likely to apply to several other iron mines linked to the Miocene magmatic activity in the whole Maghreb area, and especially along the Apenninic thrust front (locally known as Tell-Rif front).

"Bantu Spirantization: Morphologization, Lexicalization and Historical Classification","Bostoen, K.","","","","Culture & Society","This paper examines the irregular application of the sound change commonly known as 'Bantu Spirantization (BS)'  a particular type of assibilation  in front of certain common Bantu morphemes. This irregularity can to a large extent be explained as the result of the progressive morphologization (through 'dephonologization') and lexicalization to which the sound shift was exposed across Bantu. The interaction with another common Bantu sound change, i.e. the 7-to-5-vowel merger, created the conditions necessary for the morphologization of BS, while analogy played an important role in its blocking and retraction from certain morphological domains. Differing morpho-prosodic constraints are at the origin of the varying heteromorphemic conditioning of BS. These uneven morphologization patterns, especially before the agentive suffix -i, were entrenched in the lexicon thanks to the lexicalization of agent nouns. The typology of Agent Noun Spirantization (ANS) developed in this paper not only contributes to a better understanding of the historical processes underlying the varying patterns of BS morphologization and lexicalization, but also to internal Bantu classification. The different ANS types are geographically distributed in such a way that they allow to distinguish major Bantu subgroups. From a methodological point of view, this article thus shows how differential morphologization and lexicalization patterns can be used as tools for historical classification.","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","Diachronica","25, 3","","299-356","","","EN","","Scientifique","","","http://www.africamuseum.be/publication_docs/Bostoen 2008 Diachronica.pdf::accessrights:public access"
"Resolving phonological variability in Bantu lexical reconstructions: the case of 'to bake in ashes'.","Ricquier, B.||Bostoen, K.","","","","Culture & Society","The current number of Bantu lexical reconstructions is seriously inflated due to our partial understanding of diachronic semantic and phonological changes. The online Bantu Lexical Reconstructions 3 (Bastin & Schadeberg 2003) database holds numerous homophonous reconstructions having related meanings as well as multiple synonymic reconstructions whose phonological shape is only minimally dissimilar. This phenomenon is also known as osculance in Bantu studies (Guthrie 1967-1971). In this paper we argue that phonological variability in Bantu lexical reconstructions can often be resolved through a careful reanalysis of synonymic near-homophones. We demonstrate how the osculant quadruplet ° bùmb /° dùmbIk /° bùmbIk /° gùmbIk  meaning to bake in ashes can be reduced to one common Proto-Bantu form and evaluate what implications this has with respect to the history of this particular culinary technique in Bantu speech communities.","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","Africana Linguistica","14","","109-149","","","EN","","Scientifique","","","http://www.africamuseum.be/publication_docs/RicquierandBostoen 2008 AL.pdf::accessrights:public access||http://www.africamuseum.be/publication_docs/RicquierandBostoen 2008 AL appendix.pdf::accessrights:public access"

"Transmission et transformation du vocabulaire technique chez les fondeurs d'aluminium au Niger","Van der Veken, A.","","","","Culture & Society","<P style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB" lang=EN-GB>A tradition exists in historical linguistics to use a peoples language in order to reconstruct de cultural history of the people. One of the followed methods is lexical reconstruction through the method <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wörter und Sachen (Words and Things). This method has been applied for the historical reconstruction of several African techniques such as pottery, metallurgy, the fabrication of wood objects, etc. but it clearly poses problems.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN>  <P style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB" lang=EN-GB>The introduction of a new technique within a community asks for the creation of an appropriate lexicon. The study of the vocabulary of a recent technique for which we know the origin  aluminium casting  creates the opportunity to look how such a vocabulary really is constituted and to discern the different factors that play a role in the constitution. Our research shows that the transmission of a technique does not automatically involve the transmission of the vocabulary used by the introducers of the technique.<o:p></o:p></SPAN>  <P style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB" lang=EN-GB>This article gives an outline of the constitution of the lexicon and the factors that influence the process. A process of redenomination is used to form most of the terms. The casters try to find cognitive relations between the new objects and concepts that already exist in the language. The denomination takes place for instance through semantic change, composition or derivation. Besides, a lot of loanwords from French are used or the casters make use of other technical vocabularies they are familiar with. An important characteristic of the aluminium casting vocabulary is the diversity between the lexicons used by several artisans speaking the same language. A number of aspects influence the creation of a personal terminology: the professional trajectory covered by the caster, the aspect of social identity, the (socio)linguistic context that surrounds the caster, etc. The analysis of the aluminium casting vocabulary shows that the choice of words does not only discloses information on the trajectories of the individuals who carry out the technique, but also on the technique itself and on how it is perceived by the adopting community. The conclusions of our research are not only helpful for the study of new lexicons, but may also play a role in the historical analysis of older vocabularies and in the development of vocabularies to accompany new techniques.<o:p></o:p></SPAN>  <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=FR><o:p> </o:p></SPAN>","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","02486016","","","","","","","","","","Techniques et Culture","51","","98-123","","","FR","","Scientifique","","",""

"The 'capital-pillage' and the Fight Against Poverty in Mali","Panella, C.","","","","Culture & Society","Publicizing the fight against the illicit trade in African art, and simplistically connecting plunder to poverty, the Malian state catered to the donor priorities of cultural development and poverty alleviation. Malian elites promoted a misleading image of poverty not only as structural but also as the cause of the looting, and presented farmers simultaneously as looters and victims of the market economy, thereby obscuring povertys true causes. My paper will investigate this image of structural poverty by analyzing press articles of the 1990s that addressed the looting of archaeological sites in Africa, especially in Mali. In doing so, I will show that the Malian governments discourse on looting and poverty betrays a lack of interest in the deep country.

Most yield parameters were strongest affected by fallow type with more producing plants, higher bunch mass and yield after forest clearing than in bush/grass fallow. The second most important factor was HWT with more producing plants (52.3%) than in control (35.8%, p &lt; 0.0001). Fertilizer application increased the proportion of producing plants by 9%, p &lt; 0.018 and yield from 4.08-5.79 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>. Combined HWT and fertilizer had strong synergistic effects. Cultivar interacted with fallow and HWT: in bush/grass fallow yield did not differ between cultivars (2.17 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>); in forest fallow Essong produced 57% (9.4 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) more than Ebang (6.0 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, p &lt; 0.001). Essong yielded 65% more after HWT than Ebang (8.0 versus 4.9 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, p &lt; 0.001), yet not when untreated. A limited sink capacity of Ebang is likely to constrain yield increases. HWT improved root and corm health and was better in forest than in bush/grass land. In bush/grass fallow no treatment attained yields as high as in forest even when untreated and not fertilized. Soil chemical properties were not correlated with yield.  </p>","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science","54","","541-556","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""
"The embryonic cell lineage of the nematode Rhabditophanes sp.","Houthoofd, W.||Willems, M.||Jacobsen, K.||Coomans, A.||Borgonie, G.","","","","Biological collection and data management","<p>One of the unique features of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is its invariant development, where a stereotyped cell lineage generates a fixed number of cells with a fixed cell type. It remains unclear how embryonic development evolved within the nematodes to give rise to the complex, invariant cell lineage of C. elegans. Therefore, we determined the embryonic cell lineage of the nematode,<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Rhabditophanes sp. (family Alloionematidae) and made detailed cell-by-cell comparison with the known cell lineages of C. elegans, Pellioditis marina and Halicephalobus gingivalis. This gave us a unique data set of four embryonic cell lineages, which allowed a detailed comparison between these cell lineages at the level of each individual cell. This lineage comparison revealed a similar complex polyclonal fate distribution in all four nematode species (85% of the cells have the same fate).

To establish whether or not rivers constitute dispersal barriers for these rodents, we investigated the presence of these genera and their species in eight localities that are either separated by the Congo River or its tributaries. A total of 42,466 trapping nights resulted in the collection of 1185 Praomys, 233 Lophuromys and 209 Deomys ferrugineus. We observed that in almost all cases the studied species appear to have restricted distribution ranges, and that it is likely that the importance of the rivers as a barrier differs for the studied species. For example, P. misonnei was only collected from the right bank of the Congo, while P. lukolelae appears to be restricted to the left bank. In contrast, Praomys identified as P. mutoni or as members of the P. jacksoni species complex are collected on both sides of the Congo River. In contrast, all Lophuromys species were collected in a limited number of sampling sites only. L. dudui and L. luteogaster were only collected along the right bank of the Congo River, and the latter species appears to be restricted to the right bank of the Lindi River. L. huttereri and L. rita are only detected on the left bank of the Congo River. However, additional sampling is required to confirm that D. ferrugineus and L. luteogaster (so far both species have only been recorded on the right bank) do not occur in Bomane on the right bank of the Aruwimi (Ituri) River. In agreement with earlier findings for larger mammals, and pending additional taxonomical work on the P. jacksoni species complex, our findings confirm that the Congo River constitutes a barrier that limits the dispersal of all studied murids, except P. mutoni ","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","Mammalia","72 (3)","","223-228","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

Between April 2002 and March 2003, a small lowland creek was sampled monthly. Species identity of about 75% of the worms per host was determined with a genetic nuclear marker (ITSI). Each stickleback species hosted a characteristic gill- and in-parasitic Gyrodactylus: G. arcuatus Bychowsky, 1933 and G. gasterostei Glaser, 1974 respectively infecting the three-spined stickleback, with G. rarus Wegener, 1910 and G. pungitii Malmberg, 1964 infecting the nine-spined stickleback. Host size and seasonal dynamics were strong determinants of parasite abundance. A strong interaction between host and parasite species determined infection levels and affected three levels of parasite organisation: community structure, population structure and topographical specialisation. Community and population structure were shaped by asymmetric cross-infections, resulting in a net transmission of the Gyrodactylus species typical of the nine-spined stickleback towards the three-spined stickleback. I-lost density was not a major determinant of parasite exchange. Aggregation and topographical specialisation of the Gyrodactylus species of the three-spined stickleback were more pronounced than that of the nine-spined stickleback.","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA","55","","187-196","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

Helminth parasites infecting these fish were isolated from the gills, skin, muscles, body cavity, gall bladder, stomach, and intestines and were examined microscopically. Adult helminths were collected from the darter, Anhinga melanogaster, a piscivorous bird, to compare and possibly link them to the larvae recovered from fish. Stomach contents of the birds were analyzed, and their prey fish species were identified. Larval helminths collected include digenean metacercariae (clinostomes and strigeids), larval cestodes (gryporhynchids), and juvenile nematodes (Contracaecum). Adult worms include the monogeneans Macrogyrodactylus clarii, Macrogyrodactylus karibae, and Macrogyrodactylus congolensis; the digenean Clinostomum complanatum; the nematodes Paracamallanus cyathopharynx, Contracaecum rudolphi, Contracaecum multipapillatum, and Contraceacum rodhaini; and the cestodes Polyonchobothrium clarias and Echinorhynchotaenia tritesticulata.

"The mitochondrial genome of Gyrodactylus derjavinoides (Platyhelminthes :   Monogenea) - A mitogenomic approach for Gyrodactylus species and strain   identification","Huyse, T.||Buchmann, K.||Littlewood, D.","","","","Invertebrates","Systematists and evolutionary biologists are constantly on the lookout for new sources of characters to discriminate amongst taxa and estimate interrelationships within and between taxa. Entire mitochondrial genomes provide a wealth of data, both at the nucleotide and amino acid level. Molecular markers are of particular utility when applied to small, morphologically conserved taxa, as is the case for many monogenean ectoparasites of fish. Gyrodactylus species display a considerable degree of anatomical conservatism, complicating diagnostics based solely on morphology, and some are significant pests of wild and cultured fish. Here we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of Gyrodactylus derjavinoides Malmberg, Collins, Cunningham & Behiar 2007, one of the most frequently found gyrodactylid species on salmonids in Scandinavia, and compared it with the recently published genomes of Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957 and Gyrodactylus thymalli Zitnan 1960. Through comparative sliding window analysis we identified regions of high sequence variability and designed new primer sequences. In total, 6 new primer pairs have been developed, amplifying fragments of cox1, cox3, nad1, nad2, nad4, nad5 and atp6. Together, they amplify regions capturing almost half the nucleotide variability present in the complete mitochondrial genome. These degenerate primers should also work for other Gyrodactylus species parasitizing salmonids. In addition, we developed a multiplex assay that simultaneously amplifies four fragments in a single PCR reaction. Besides the diagnostic value, these fragments can be used for studying the transmission dynamics of Gyrodactylus, providing crucial information for an improved understanding of the spread and epidemiology of these important fish pathogens.

We used nuclear microsatellite markers to study genetic relationships among all encountered multilocus genotypes, and combined this with a phylogenetic approach using DNA sequence data of three mitochondrial genes. Analyses of mitochondrial gene sequence divergence showed the presence of three very distinct clades that likely represent cryptic undescribed species. Our phylogenetic results suggest that the Daphnia pulicaria group, a complex of predominantly North American species that has diversified rapidly since the Pleistocene, has its origin in South America, as specific tests of topology indicated that all three South American lineages are ancestral to the North American members of this species group. A comparison between variation of nuclear and mitochondrial markers revealed that closely related polyploid nuclear genotypes sometimes belonged to very divergent mitochondrial lineages, while distantly related nuclear genotypes often belonged to the same mitochondrial lineage. This discrepancy suggests that these South American water fleas originated through reciprocal hybridization between different endemic, sexually reproducing parental lineages. It is also likely that polyploidy of the investigated lineages resulted from this hybridization. Nevertheless, no putative diploid parental lineages were found in the studied region.","","2008","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03679.x","","","","","","",""," MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","17","","1789-1800","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

These are the first species of polystomatids to be described from caecilian hosts. The parasites are small with a maximum body length of 2 mm. The two gut caeca are not confluent posteriorly and have neither diverticula nor anastomoses. The haptor bears six well-developed suckers and one pair of hamuli. The single follicular testis lies in the mid-body and the ovary is small. Vaginae are present. A single large, operculate egg lies in the short uterus, which leads to an armed genital bulb. Neither the nature of the oncomiracidium nor the phylogenetic position of these worms is known. Nanopolystoma n. g. shares various morphological features with other polystomatid genera; however, the non-confluent gut-caeca lacking diverticula and the presence of skeletal elements in the haptoral suckers place it with the chelonian polystomes of the subfamily Polystomoidinae. These findings suggest that the caecilian host species are probably semi-aquatic.

In this talk, the morphology and ultrastructure of a new genus, widespread in West Africa but exceedingly rare in museum collections, is described and discussed. The genus single constituent species can be distinghuished from other oonopids by its peculiar type of carapace microsculpture and posteriorly situated epigastric groove. Externally, females lack specialized epigastric structures. The male has an inward-curved embolus and a ventral pouch, a deep depression between the labium and sternum that accomodates the tips of both emboli. Similar features have been documented from several known genera of Oonopidae (e.g. Grymeus Harvey, 1987, Silhouettella Benoit, 1979) and also occur in many presently undescribed genera.<FONT size=3> </FONT>","","2008","Colloque et congrès scientifique","no","","","","","","","","","","","","24th European Congress of Arachnology","","","","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

"Bidirectional Introgressive Hybridization between a Cattle and Human Schistosome Species","Huyse, T.||Webster, B.||Geldof, S.||Stothard, J.||Diaw, O.||Polman, K.||Rollinson, D.","","","","Invertebrates","Schistosomiasis is a disease of great medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions, caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma (subclass Digenea). Following major water development schemes in the 1980s, schistosomiasis has become an important parasitic disease of children living in the Senegal River Basin (SRB). During molecular parasitological surveys, nuclear and mitochondrial markers revealed unexpected natural interactions between a bovine and human Schistosoma species: S. bovis and S. haematobium, respectively. Hybrid schistosomes recovered from the urine and faeces of children and the intermediate snail hosts of both parental species, Bulinus truncatus and B. globosus, presented a nuclear ITS rRNA sequence identical to S. haematobium, while the partial mitochondrial cox1 sequence was identified as S. bovis. Molecular data suggest that the hybrids are not 1st generation and are a result of parental and/or hybrid backcrosses, indicating a stable hybrid zone. Larval stages with the reverse genetic profile were also found and are suggested to be F1 progeny. The data provide indisputable evidence for the occurrence of bidirectional introgressive hybridization between a bovine and a human Schistosoma species. Hybrid species have been found infecting B. truncatus, a snail species that is now very abundant throughout the SRB. The recent increase in urinary schistosomiasis in the villages along the SRB could therefore be a direct effect of the increased transmission through B. truncatus. Hybridization between schistosomes under laboratory conditions has been shown to result in heterosis (higher fecundity, faster maturation time, wider intermediate host spectrum), having important implications on disease prevalence, pathology and treatment. If this new hybrid exhibits the same hybrid vigour, it could develop into an emerging pathogen, necessitating further control strategies in zones where both parental species overlap.","","2009","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","10.1371/journal.ppat.1000571","","","","","","","","PLOS PATHOGENS","5","","","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

"Morphology and molecular taxonomy of Gyrodactylus jennyae n. sp (Monogenea) from tadpoles of captive Rana catesbeiana Shaw (Anura), with  a review of the species of Gyrodactylus Nordmann, 1832 parasitising amphibians","Paetow, L.||Cone, D.||Huyse, T.||Mclaughlin, J.||Marcogliese, D.","","","","Invertebrates","Gyrodactylus jennyae n. sp. is described from the body surface and mouthparts of tadpoles of the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana Shaw imported presumably from Missouri, USA, into a federal government facility in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. Its morphology resembles most closely that of G. chologastris Mizelle, Whittaker & McDougal, 1969 described from two amblyopsids (blind cave fishes) in Kentucky and North Carolina. Both species have long slender hamuli, a ventral bar with a relatively long membrane and small anterolateral processes, a cirrus with two rows of small spines and marginal hooks with a well-developed sickle heel and short handle. The two species differ morphologically; G. jennyae has a marginal hook sickle with a more pronounced heel than that found in G. chologastris. A BLAST search using a 945 base pair sequence that included the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 and the 5.8S rRNA gene from G. jennyae n. sp. showed that the overall similarity with other Gyrodactylus sequences on GenBank was relatively low. The ITS1 region was similar to that of G. misgurni Ling, 1962; however, no ITS2 and 5.8S rRNA sequences are available for that species. A separate search using 5.8S sequences revealed that G. markakulensis Gvosdev, 1950 and G. laevis Malmberg, 1957 were the closest to G. jennyae (1 and 2 bp differences, respectively). These species are parasites of cyprinids (or their predators) and are similar to G. jennyae and G. chologastris in having a double row of small hooks on the cirrus and overall similar morphologies of the haptoral hard parts. There are now five species of Gyrodactylus described exclusively from amphibians and this appears to have involved at least three separate host-switches from fishes.","","2009","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","10.1007/s11230-009-9183-9","","","","","","","","SYSTEMATIC PARASITOLOGY","73","","219-227","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

The site was at Mbouroukou near Melong at 1200 m above sea level on volcanic soils. Banana was the susceptible reference crop. Sampling of roots and rhizosphere soil was undertaken at 4 months after planting. A non-parametric ANOVA revealed significant differences in P. goodeyi root population densities among the treatments (crops). Crops were classified as good hosts of P. goodeyi when their mean root densities were statistically similar to banana. When mean P. goodeyi root densities were significantly lower than banana but higher than 1000 100 g-1 FRW, crops were classified as intermediate hosts. Crops with a mean P. goodeyi root density significantly lower than banana and lower than 1000 nematodes 100 g-1 FRW were classified either as poor hosts (&gt;20 P. goodeyi 100 g-1 FRW) or very poor hosts (&#8804;20 P. goodeyi 100 g-1 FRW). Beans and maize (cv. CMS 8704) were good hosts of P. goodeyi; watermelon and onion were intermediate hosts; maize (cv.

Hylomyscus walterverheyeni occupies both lowland and mountain forests (up to 2000m asl). In our phylogenetic analyses, the CVL specimens form a monophyletic group.

A one-year-long monthly series is presented for the Congo River, upstream from the Kinshasa/Brazzaville urban zone. Spatial and temporal variations in the Amazon River and its main tributaries have been studied. Both Congo and Amazon convey similar mean &#948;30Si signatures (close to +0.8) to the ocean, in the range of previously published values. The Congo River exhibits limited seasonal variations, with the exception of some large &#948;30Si variations that seem related to the presence of high biogenic silicon content in the water column. This could be due to diatom activities at the level of the Pool Malebo, a lake-like widening in the lower reaches of the Congo River upstream of Brazzaville. In contrast, other rivers such as the Mekong (Vietnam) and the Tana (Kenya) can exhibit much higher &#948;30Si values of up to +2. These differences may be linked to different parameters including higher weathering rate and human impact.","","2009","Colloque et congrès scientifique","no","","","","","","","","","","","","ASLO meeting","","","","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

The lightest &#948;30Si (close to 0) are observed in the Congo tributaries characterized by high organic content (black rivers).When comparing data across these different tropical rivers, we observe a strong correlation between &#948;30Si and pH that could reflect the link between Si isotopic fractionation and different processes including rock weathering and clays formation and dissolution.","","2009","Colloque et congrès scientifique","no","","","","","","","","","","","","Third scientific meeting of the Hybam Observatory on amazonian rivers","","","","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""
"Seasonal and spatial variations of silicon isotopes in large tropical rivers","Hughes, H.||Cardinal, D.||Cocquyt, C.||Bouillon, S.||Borges, A.V.||Pandi, A.||André, L.","","","","Surface environments and collection management","We present the first large dataset of dissolved silicon isotopes signatures (&#948;30Si) in different tropical rivers, including the Amazon and the Congo, the two largest silicon suppliers to the world ocean. A two-years long monthly series was obtained in the Congo River, upstream of the Kinshasa/Brazzaville urban zone. Spatial and temporal variations in the Amazon River and its main tributaries were studied for one year. Both the Congo and Amazon rivers convey similar mean &#948;30Si signatures to the ocean (close to +0.8), in the range of the few previously published data for those rivers. The Congo River exhibits limited seasonal variations, with the exception of some large &#948;30Si variations that seem related to the presence of high biogenic silicon content. This could be due to assimilation by diatoms in Pool Malebo, a lake-like widening in the lower reaches of the Congo River upstream of Brazzaville. In contrast, other rivers such as the Mekong (Vietnam) and the Tana (Kenya) can exhibit much heavier &#948;30Si values of up to +2. The lightest &#948;30Si (close to 0) are observed in the Congo tributaries characterized by high organic content (black rivers).When comparing data across these different tropical rivers, we observe a strong correlation between &#948;30Si and pH that could reflect the link between Si isotopic fractionation and different processes including rock weathering and clays formation and dissolution.","","2009","Colloque et congrès scientifique","no","","","","","","","","","","","","First World Young Earth-Scientists Congress","","","","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

"Early Plant Cultivation in the Central African Rain Forest: First Millennium BC Pearl Millet from South Cameroon","Kahlheber, S.||Bostoen, K.||Neumann , K.","","","","Culture & Society","The Bantu expansion, a major topic in African archaeology and history, is widely assumed to correlate with the spread of farming, but archaeological data on the subsistence of these putative early Bantu speakers are very sparse. However, finds of domesticated pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) in southern Cameroonian archaeological sites, dated between 400 and 200 BC, open new perspectives on the history of agriculture in the  Central African rain forest.   Linguistic evidence suggests that pearl millet was part of early agricultural traditions of Bantu speakers,  and has to a great extent been distributed during the course of their expansion over large parts of western Bantu-speaking Africa, possibly even originally from their homeland in the Nigerian-Cameroonian borderland.   In combining archaeobotanical, palaeoenvironmental and linguistic data, we put forward the hypothesis that an agricultural system with pearl millet was brought into the rain forest during the first millennium BC, and that its pread across Central Africa coincided with the dispersal of certain Bantu language subgroups.","","2009","Article scientifique peer reviewed","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal of African Archaeology","7, 2","","253-272","","","EN","","Scientifique","","",""

The methodology focuses on the evaluation of the STERNA approach, in particular, the supply side, i.e. the individual organisations that participate in the STERNA network. This participation is understood in the technical sense that an organisation has digital content connected to the distributed semantic digital library system that allows for searching and accessing the pool of distributed and heterogeneous bird related information of the STERNA partners.  This document is primarily intended to inform and guide those who will be involved in the evaluation of the STERNA approach. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the content of the document and related other tasks and deliverables. The chapters 2-4 describe the context and objectives of the STERNA project, the goals of the STERNA approach, and the role Semantic Web standards (RDF, SKOS), the distributed digital library architecture, and the use of open source technologies and software as service concept play in the STERNA approach. Chapter 5 addresses the question of what we want to learn from the evaluation of the STERNA approach and, therefore, what needs to be evaluated. Chapter 6 describes in detail the evaluation methodology, including basic principles and expectations, focus points and framework (dimensions, criteria, questions), who will be involved and what methods will be used, how the results will be analysed and summarised, and who will be the target groups of the results and recommendations. Finally, chapter 7 presents the evaluation timetable.","","2009","Rapport","no","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EN","STERNA: Semantic Web-based Thematic European Reference Network Application ( European )","Scientifique","","",""

Methods  Seventeen metals (including Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, U) and non-metals (including As) were measured by ICP-MS in urine spot samples from 351 subjects (32% women), aged 274 yr (mean 33 yr). Forty subjects (controls) lived 400 km outside the mining area; 311 subjects lived in the mining area, either very close (<3 km) (n=179; 6 communities) or moderately close (310 km) (n=132; 4 communities) to mines or smelting plants.    Results  For all metals (except Ni) urinary concentrations were significantly higher in subjects from the mining area than in control subjects. In subjects living very close to mines or smelting plants, the geometric means (25th75th percentile) of urinary concentrations, expressed as ìg/g creatinine, were 17.8 (10.929.0) for As, 0.75 (0.381.16) for Cd, 15.7 (5.2743.2) for Co, 17.1 (8.4443.2) for Cu, 3.17 (1.475.49) for Pb and 0.028 (0.0130.065) for U, these values being significantly higher than those of subjects living 310 km from mines or industrial operations. Urinary Co concentrations were markedly elevated, exceeding 15 ìg/g creatinine in 53% of the subjects, and even 87% of children (<14 yr), living very close to the mining areas. Urinary As was also high (79% above 10 ìg/g creatinine in subjects living very close to the mining areas). Compared with background values from the US general population, subjects living very close to areas of mining or refining had 4-, 43-, 5- and 4-fold higher urinary concentrations of Cd, Co, Pb and U, respectively.    Conclusions  This first biomonitoring study of metal exposure in the African Copperbelt reveals a substantial exposure to several metals, especially in children. The urinary Co concentrations found in this population are the highest ever reported for a general population. The pathways of exposure and health significance of these findings need to be further investigated.

Biological diversity is widespread across different types of habitats, including protected and non protected sites. In different countries, a number of institutions have been involved for some decades in data collection, in most cases in collaboration with international partners.    The CABIN (Central African Biodiversity Information Network) project, supported by the Belgian General Direction of Development Cooperation, has identified the lack of efficient networking as an impediment to the sustainable management of biodiversity data, with an impact on local development. Networking amongst research centres and higher learning institutions is needed to maximize the use of limited expertise, to maximize information sharing and to promote effective and cost efficient biodiversity informatics capacity building activities within the central African region and beyond.    Africa needs to benefit from recent advances in information technology. A survey showed that there is an increased willingness to share primary biodiversity data within Africa. For the method to work, several limitations must be overcome, including a lack of high-quality taxonomic determination, imprecise georeferencing of data, and the poor availability of high-quality, updated, taxonomic treatments.    Geographic scopes and topics for networking greatly vary and can be considered at country, regional and continental levels.    Agriculture is a key area where access to information about taxonomy and biodiversity is crucial. This sector plays a key role as a major economic activity intertwined with peoples livelihoods in Africa.    CABIN is planning to collaborate with existing institutions and ongoing projects in Africa. As a pilot project, eight collaborators have been selected from Central Africa: four major agriculture research stations (Mvuazi, Mulungu, Yangambi, Nyoka) and four universities (Bukavu, Kisangani, Kinshasa, Yangambi). In collaboration with UniversiTic and CEPDEC (Capacity Enhancement Programme for Developing Countries) of GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), CABIN will organize a training workshop in 2010 for scientists from those research centers and universities on standards for digitizing data for easy sharing. In future, this activity may be expanded to other parts of Africa.    Biodiversity Informatics techniques have the potential not only to support fundamental studies , but also to assist developing countries in tackling biodiversity management issues in practical ways.","Open Journal System Proceedings of TDWG","2009","Colloque et congrès scientifique","yes","","","","http://www.tdwg.org/proceedings/article/view/473","","","http://www.tdwg.org/proceedings/article/view/473","","","","","Presentation at the TDWG 2009 Annual Conference","2009","","","","","EN","Central African Biodiversity Information Network ( Federal )","Scientifique","","",""
