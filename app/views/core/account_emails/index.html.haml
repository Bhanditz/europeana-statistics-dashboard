    %p Why add additional emails?
    %p.pykhelp Your primary account at Europeana might be registered with your personal email ID. 
    %p.pykhelp Later an organisation invites you to collaborate on a project to your corporate email ID. In such a case, you might not want to create a separate Europeana account. 
    %p.pykhelp Hence, add your corporate email ID as a secondary email in your Europeana and the collaboration request will route to your personal Europeana account.
