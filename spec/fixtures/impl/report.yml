  html_content: "The Europeana Statistics Dashboard has been developed to act as a space where partners, researchers, stakeholders and anyone interested in Europeana can interact and re-use the statistics coming out of our websites and services. Europeana is a network, representing more than 2,500 cultural heritage organisations and a thousand individuals from these and other walks of life, passionate about bringing Europe’s vast wealth of cultural heritage to the world. \r\n\r\nTraditionally our statistics and metrics have been locked up in formatted documents, now we are liberating that data, visualising it and making it embeddable and re-useable. With this dashboard it is now much easier to see how Europeana has progressed and evolved through the years and how we are working to increase the reach of our data providers’ collections. Many of the visualisations are dynamic and utilise both the Europeana and Google Analytics APIs to generate charts that are accurate and up to date. \r\n\r\nSome of the key metrics that we are visualising in this dashboard include traffic and usage figures for the Europeana.eu website, social media reach, the size and composition of the Europeana repository, together with the number of digital object views on Europeana for a selection of our data providers. \r\n\r\nAn alpha version of the Statistics Dashboard was released in October 2014 and a beta version is due to be realised in 2015. During this alpha phase we are eager to hear your feedback, also if you are a data provider and would like to have statistics related to your collection available via this dashboard please [**contact us**][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://statistics.europeana.eu/contact"
